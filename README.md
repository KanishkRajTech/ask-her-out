# Ask Her Out ❤️

This is a fun and interactive web project designed to create a playful experience when asking someone out. It includes a sequence of pages with animated GIFs and progressively humorous attempts to persuade the user to say "Yes."

## Features ✨
- Cute and funny GIFs from Tenor
- Interactive buttons that navigate through different responses
- A playful JavaScript effect that makes the "No" button move randomly on the last page
- Responsive design for smooth experience on all devices

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works 🧐
1. The first page asks the question: **"Do you love me?"** with two buttons: **Yes** and **No**.
2. If "No" is clicked, the user is taken to another page encouraging them to reconsider.
3. This cycle continues with different responses and GIFs.
4. On the last "No" page, the "No" button starts moving randomly to prevent the user from clicking it.
5. When the user finally clicks "Yes," they are taken to a final page that celebrates the moment with a heartwarming message.
